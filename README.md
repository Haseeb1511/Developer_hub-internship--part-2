* Anomaly Detection
* Multi-label Classification
* Satellite Image Analysis
* Credit Risk Assessment

## üìä Task 1: Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection

**Objective:**
Build a tool to identify anomalies in stock price trends to detect unusual activities or market manipulations.

**Dataset:**
[Yahoo Finance Stock Market Dataset](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

**Steps:**

1. Download and preprocess historical stock price data for selected companies.
2. Calculate financial indicators:

   * Simple Moving Average (SMA)
   * Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   * Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   * Bollinger Bands
3. Apply unsupervised anomaly detection techniques such as Isolation Forest or DBSCAN.
4. Use LSTM or Facebook Prophet for time-series forecasting to detect deviations.
5. Visualize detected anomalies on stock price trends.

**Expected Outcome:**
A tool/report highlighting anomalies and potential market manipulations.

## üòÑ Task 2: Multi-Label Emotion Recognition from Text

**Objective:**
Develop a system to classify multiple emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) present in text.

**Dataset:**
[GoEmotions Dataset by Google](https://github.com/google-research/goemotions)

**Steps:**

1. Preprocess the dataset and address class imbalance.
2. Fine-tune a transformer model (e.g., BERT) for multi-label classification.
3. Evaluate performance using:

   * Hamming Loss
   * F1 Score
4. Test on real-world text data (customer feedback, social media).

**Expected Outcome:**
A robust system capable of analysing emotional tones with multiple labels.

## üí≥ Task 3: Credit Risk Analysis

**Objective:**
Assess the creditworthiness of customers and flag high-risk individuals.

**Dataset:**
[Give Me Some Credit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit)

**Steps:**

1. Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, imbalance using SMOTE).
2. Engineer features like income, debt, and repayment history.
3. Train models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
4. Evaluate using relevant metrics (Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Precision/Recall).

**Expected Outcome:**
A system to help reduce default rates by identifying high-risk customers.
